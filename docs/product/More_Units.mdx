# Menu More Units

The **Menu More Units** feature allows you to create multiple sizes or variations of a parent item. For example:  

- **Parent Item:** Pizza  
- **Child Items / Variations:** Small, Medium, Large (with different prices)  

This is managed using the **item_level** dropdown, allowing you to chain all variations to the parent item.  

**Example Structure:**  

| Item | Product ID | Master Product ID |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Pizza (Parent) | 001 | - |
| Pizza Small | 001 | 001 |
| Pizza Medium | 001 | 001 |
| Pizza Large | 001 | 001 |

> **Tip:** In the POS, users will see **one button** for Pizza. When clicked, it will show the available sizes/options.

### 3. Create Child Items / Variations
1. From the **item_level** dropdown, select **1** for the child item.  
2. Add a **unique product code** for this variation.  
3. Repeat the process to add all variations (e.g., Small, Medium, Large), making sure each has the **same master_product_id** as the parent item.  
4. Click **Save** after each entry.

### 4. Verify Linked Items
- Scroll down to the **Linked Products** section.  
- Here you can confirm that all variations are properly linked to the parent item.  
- This helps in understanding how items are chained and ensures they will display correctly in the POS.

✅ **Tip:** Using **Menu More Units** ensures that the POS interface remains clean, showing a single parent item while giving access to all size or variation options.
